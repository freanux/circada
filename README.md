# Circada IRC client
I work often in console or in a SSH session. So I have to use an irc console client. For years I used Irssi, then I tried out WeeChat for a while. Then I switched back to Irssi.

WeeChat is too fancy for me, I don’t like to turn off all these bling bling colors before I can work with. I like Irssi very much, but it lacks of the nicklist on the right side, or the overview of all connected servers with its opened channels on the left.

So I decided to write my own IRC client completely from scratch in C++. It’s a fine mixture of Irssi and WeeChat:
